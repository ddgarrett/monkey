# Monkey

From ["Writing An Interpreter In Go"](https://interpreterbook.com/). 

This implements an interpreter for the [Monkey programming language](https://monkeylang.org/) as defined by Thorsten Ball.

Why do this? A few reasons:

1. I've always been curious about interpreters and transpilers (source to source compilers) since my first job involved using a transpiler.

2. Once I have an implementation of an interpreter using an abstract syntax tree (AST) it might be fun
to extend it to add new programming elements, creating my own scripting language.

3. One of the extensions that might be fun to add is an implementation of the [MongoLang](https://github.com/ddgarrett/mongolang) library, an "easier" to use implementation of MongoDB access in Go, which might in turn provide a scripting language for using MongoDB.

4. I want to continue to learn more about the Go programming language itself and best practices in programming with Go.
